      <h1>SHORT STORY OF NC</h1>
      <br />
      <h3>
        Our name, “NewCombin”, reminds us about the “new combination” between
        seasoned executives and young professionals, characterized by a
        disruptive mindset.
      </h3>
      <br />
      <h3>
        It is not a mere coincidence: Marcelo and Nicolás, NC’s founders, are a
        father and a son gathered by the ambition of empowering businesses
        through technology.
      </h3>
      <br />
      <h3>
        And if in everyday life, parents share their wisdom and children their
        creativity, at NewCombin we combine those characteristics in our team to
        bring unique and high-quality solutions to our clients.
      </h3>
      <br />
      <h3>
        NewCombin was born by the end of 2017 and, at the beginning of 2018, we
        already were working as a start-up. At the end of that year, Ian joined
        the founders, and they created the best team to make the business grow.
      </h3>
      <br />
      <h3>
        Each year since its foundation, NewCombin grew 300% and achieved its
        presence in the American continent, helping businesses with software
        development and digital transformation.

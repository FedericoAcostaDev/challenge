# Tecnical Challenge

Created using React.js | React DOM
Axios to fetching the data from the API
Styled with CSS & custom styled components.

Approach:
Postman to retrieve the tokens.
I started positioning the main elements, using only React components to keep the App clean.
I continued by creating a custom form.
Sadly, I wasn't able to finish all the requirements, but I decided to share it with you anyways.
